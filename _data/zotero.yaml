  abstract: >-
    In Syria, interfaith dialogue constitutes a public practice that speaks to
    ethical, social and political imaginaries. As an official practice, it helps
    to provide the regime with religious legitimacy, though unofficially it
    often functions as a euphemism for missionary efforts. On a more abstract
    level, a careful analysis of Syrian interfaith dialogue reveals that
    different ethical traditions inform the participants' vision of "good." The
    Muslim sheikhs in this case-study follow an Aristotelian model of ethics
    that presupposes pious individuals for the creation and preservation of a
    moral society. Accordingly, they aim at fostering inter-communal harmony by
    teaching people how to perform virtues, rather than teaching them about
    other religions. Conversely, the Christian priests share a model that
    combines post-Enlightenment rationalism with "Christian love," and thus they
    strive to advance tolerance by encouraging unconditional affection,
    intellectual and experiential awareness of others. Together, these
    discrepancies facilitate miscommunication among the participants of
    dialogue.

  abstract: >-
    The triad of Jews, Gentiles and Christians seems clearly arranged in the
    religious
     world of the Roman Empire. However, a closer look shows that this is too simple a
     model in that it neither does justice to the diverse descriptions of these groups
     or those of others, nor to their respective concepts of identity or the varying mechanisms
     of inclusions and exclusions. This volume illustrates this by way of interdisciplinary
     individual studies on Asia Minor, but also through conceptional considerations. In
     summary, the editors offer new terminology suggestions

  abstract: >-
    In this article, we review the psychology of religion and radicalization. In
    doing so, we note that both macro-level approaches (that study structural
    conditions in society) and micro-level approaches (that focus on
    psychological coping and personal appraisal of individual conditions) fail
    to adequately explain radical behavior of members of extreme religious
    groups. Instead, we propose that meso-level approaches best explain
    religious radicalization. These meso-level approaches explain how members of
    extreme religious groups appraise societal conditions and find redemption in
    radical beliefs. In particular, we argue for a more in-depth examination of
    the historical and societal contexts in which various radicalization
    processes take place and narratives of radical redemption hold sway.

  abstract: >-
    Christian syncretism is but a surface aspect of voodoo, the Haitian folk
    religion that has two major African sources. The rada cult comes from
    Dahomey whereas the petro cult, which is usually said to be Creole, has its
    roots among the Kongo. This twofold contribution is analysed from structural
    and historical viewpoints. The petro divinities are associated with fire and
    magic, even witchcraft; their rites sometimes require that the most dreadful
    of them be `attached' or `chained' to pieces of wood. Certain rada
    divinities, beneficial and peaceful, have violent congeners in the petro
    pantheon. Each cult has distinct altars in the temple. Near Gonaives in
    northern Haiti is a temple devoted to the worship of purely Kongo
    divinities, who are placed under the authority of a king and queen that
    remind us of the Kingo kingdom. Both structural and historical perspectives
    are needed for a full under-standing of syncretism.

- id: desmanglesFacesGodsVodou2000a
  abstract: >-
    Vodou, the folk religion of Haiti, is a by-product of the contact between
    Roman Catholicism and African and Amerindian traditional religions. In this
    book, Leslie Desmangles analyzes the mythology and rituals of Vodou,
    focusing particularly on the inclusion of West African and European elements
    in Vodouisants' beliefs and practices.Desmangles sees Vodou not simply as a
    grafting of European religious traditions onto African stock, but as a true
    creole phenomenon, born out of the oppressive conditions of slavery and the
    necessary adaptation of slaves to a New World environment.Desmangles uses
    Haitian history to explain this phenomenon, paying particular attention to
    the role of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century maroon communities in
    preserving African traditions and the attempts by the Catholic, educated
    elite to suppress African-based "superstitions." The result is a society in
    which one religion, Catholicism, is visible and official; the other, Vodou,
    is unofficial and largely secretive.

  abstract: >-
    Intercultural Communication provides a critical introduction to the dynamic
    arena of communication across different cultural and social strata.
    Throughout this book, topics are revisited, extended, interwoven, and
    deconstructed, with the reader’s understanding strengthened by tasks and
    follow-up questions.

    The fourth edition of this popular textbook has been updated to feature:

    ■ new readings by Kwame Antony Appiah, Yoshitaka Miike, Edward Ademolu and
    Siobhan Warrington, Helena Liu, and Michael Zirulnik and Mark Orbe, which
    reflect the most recent developments in the field;

    ■ refreshed and expanded examples and tasks including new material on an
    Asiacentric approach to intercultural communication, selfies as a global
    discourse, the impact on intercultural communication of English as a lingua
    franca in multinational organisations, and representations of Africa in
    charity media campaigns;

    ■ extended discussions of topics including intercultural training,
    voluntourism, challenging essentialism in business contexts, and
    intersectional approaches to identity;

    ■ revised further reading suggestions.

    Written by experienced teachers and researchers in the field, this fourth
    edition of Intercultural Communication is an essential textbook for advanced
    students studying this topic.

  abstract: >-
    "Although ethnic and sectarian tensions have always been a feature of modern
    Indian history, the country was founded and governed in its first decades by
    a nationalist political movement - associated with the Indian National
    Congress -- that stressed the non-sectarian nature of Indian citizenship.
    Hindu nationalism, a contrary political force, was born in the 1920s but
    didn't take off politically until the 1990s. It finally secured national
    power in 2014 when a populist leader, Narendra Modi -- a former governor of
    the province of Gujarat -- leveraged a reputation for successful economic
    reform and popular resentment toward the country's Muslim minority to lead
    his Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, to national victory. In this book,
    Christophe Jaffrelot recounts how the Hindu nationalist movement under the
    leadership of Modi's BJP has deeply transformed the country. Jaffrelot's
    main argument is that the reign of Modi and his BJP has ushered India into a
    new type of regime - what he calls ethnic democracy. Modi's rule relies
    undeniably on popular consent. (In last month's Indian federal elections,
    Modi consolidated his 2014 win with a decisive electoral victory.) But under
    the BJP India has largely jettisoned the country's previous commitment to
    the preservation of the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. This book
    is based both on the author's long years of research in India and on recent
    extensive interviews conducted across the country with civil servants,
    government supporters, opponents of the BJP, and members of religious
    minorities. Because of the tense atmosphere of intimidation throughout the
    country, many of Jaffrelot's interlocuters refused to speak on the record;
    he has given them pseudonyms in this book. The book recounts how proponents
    of secularism and pluralism, including academics and NGO workers, have been
    brought to heel; how Christians and Muslims have been increasingly
    marginalized in national and regional elections; and how the Hindu
    nationalist government has fostered the development of a shadow "cultural
    police force" -- with formal and informal ties to the state -- that censors
    public speech and intimidates political opponents. The book begins with an
    overview political history of modern India, explaining how the modern Indian
    state arose out of the heritage of British colonialism and then out of the
    Indian Congress-led national liberation movement. The bulk of the book takes
    up the rise and the rule of Hindu nationalism - Hindutva - and that of the
    strongman Modi, whose canny brand of populism has proven to be a game
    changer"--

  abstract: >-
    Multiple religious belonging, also known as double belonging, refers to the
    idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While
    this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as Asia with its many
    religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion
    belonging with respect to religious traditions such as Judaism,
    Christianity, and Islam.Those who practice double belonging claim to be an
    adherent of two different religions at the same time or incorporate the
    practices of another religion into their own faith life. It is increasing
    with globalisation. One such example is a person attending a Christian
    church but also finding meaning in yoga and in forms of meditation inspired
    by Eastern traditions, and enjoying attending a Jewish Seder at Passover.

  abstract: >-
    Interfaith dialogue is commonly used in building peace and understanding
    among religious groups. Such a project, however, is only significant if it
    is not only executed by religious leaders and scholars, but also involves
    lay people at the grassroots level. In this article, I present findings of
    my fieldwork in a small village in East Java, Indonesia where land authority
    problems became a common ground for conducting interfaith cooperation. I
    observed interfaith empowerment efforts led by a group of Catholic activists
    and students who arrived in 1997, which successfully supported the villagers
    in claiming their land. According to Knitter (1995), grassroots interfaith
    cooperation will necessarily be followed by interfaith dialogue. My general
    finding is that in communities that have a lack of knowledge of their own
    particular religions, subsequent dialogue may take other forms which are
    different from that of Knitter's description.

    This entry surveys Sikhism in the context of the ethnography of Sikh
    communities in India and other countries. Attention is paid to issues of
    definition, core Sikh beliefs, the evolution of Sikh communities, and the
    formation of Sikh identity. The complex issues of caste and gender are
    considered, and briefer mention is made of time and place. The internet's
    role in Sikh representation and transnational Sikh community formation is
    noted, together with orientalism's contribution to the emergence of Sikhism
    as a “world religion.”

    The Sikh religion has a following of over 20 million people worldwide.
    However,events such as the verbal and physical attacks on Sikhs just after
    September 11, where Sikhs were being mistaken for Muslims, suggest that the
    Sikh faith still remains mysterious to many. This Very Short Introduction
    introduces newcomers to the meaning of the Sikh religious tradition, its
    teachings, practices, rituals and festivals. Eleanor Nesbitt highlights and
    contextualizes the key threads in the history of Sikhism, from the first
    Gurus to martyrdom, militarization, and the increasingly significant
    diaspora. Examining gender, caste, and the changes that are currently
    underway in the faith, Nesbitt considers contemporary Sikh identities and
    their role in our world. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions
    series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost
    every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get
    ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis,
    perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging
    topics highly readable.

    The contribution of monks to the evangelization of lands not yet reached by
    the preaching of the Gospel has certainly been remarkable. The specific
    witness that the monastic community gives is of a radical Christian life
    naturally radiating outward, and thus it is implicitly missionary. The
    process of inculturation of Christian monasticism in China required a bold
    spiritual attitude of openness to the future and a willingness to accept the
    transformation of monastic forms that had been received. In Christian Monks
    on Chinese Soil, Matteo Nicolini-Zani highlights the willingness of foreign
    monks to encounter the cultural and spiritual realities of China and the
    degree of acceptance by the Chinese of the form of monastic life that was
    presented to them by the missionaries.

    Interfaith dialogue is increasingly being recognised by governments across
    Europe as crucial to developing cohesive communities. This article
    critically analyses approaches for developing strategies to promote
    interfaith dialogue between individuals and/or organisations within civil
    society. It does this by drawing on a series of theoretical questions
    concerning those who are involved (and missing), what the dialogue is for,
    and how the dynamics of participation and representation are handled. In the
    process, the article considers the conditions, spaces, processes,
    relationships and understandings of identity that can enable successful
    interfaith dialogue, and how these might be developed in ways which address
    the issues raised. The original theoretical analysis presented in this
    article is supported by examples from the author’s cumulative research with
    policymakers and practitioners across Europe since 2004.

    The papers in this volume were presented at a Mellon-Sawyer Seminar held at
    the University of Oxford in 2009-2010, which sought to investigate side by
    side the two important movements of conversion that frame late antiquity: to
    Christianity at its start, and to Islam at the other end. Challenging the
    opposition between the two stereotypes of Islamic conversion as an
    intrinsically violent process, and Christian conversion as a fundamentally
    spiritual one, the papers seek to isolate the behaviours and circumstances
    that made conversion both such a common and such a contested phenomenon. The
    spread of Buddhism in Asia in broadly the same period serves as an external
    comparator that was not caught in the net of the Abrahamic religions. The
    volume is organised around several themes, reflecting the concerns of the
    initial project with the articulation between norm and practice, the role of
    authorities and institutions, and the social and individual fluidity on the
    ground

  abstract: >-
    Our understanding and perceptions of the conquest period in Latin American
    history have been profoundly altered by the scholarship of the past twenty
    years. The traditional triumphalist narrative of the Spanish Conquest
    focused heavily on the conquistadors in Mexico and Peru, and emphasized the
    inevitability and rapidity of military victory, religious conversion (the
    Spiritual Conquest), and colonization. The revisionist New Conquest History
    – which emerged in part from a renewed emphasis on archival and paleographic
    work and in part from the New Philology, a school of scholarship based on
    the analysis of colonial-period primary sources in Mesoamerican languages –
    complicates that narrative by emphasizing multiple protagonists and
    accounts, new source materials, the roles and interpretations of indigenous
    and black men and women, and the examination of understudied regions of the
    Americas.

    Female Power and Religious Change in the Medieval Near East engages with two
    levels of scholarly discussion that are all too often dealt with separately
    in modern scholarship: the Islamization of the Near East and the place of
    women in pre-modern Near Eastern societies. It outlines how these two lines
    of inquiry can and should be read in an integrative manner. Major historical
    themes such as conversion to Islam, Islamization, religious violence, and
    the regulation of Muslim/non-Muslim ties are addressed and reframed by
    attending to the relatively hidden, yet highly meaningful, role that women
    played in these.This book is about the history of Islam from the perspective
    of female social agents. It argues that irrespective of their religious
    affiliation, women possessed crucial means for affecting or hindering
    religious changes, not only in the form of religious conversion, but also in
    the adoption of practices and the delineation of communal boundaries. Its
    focus on the role and significance of female power in moments of religious
    change within family households offers a historical angle that has hitherto
    been relatively absent from modern scholarship. Rather than locating signs
    of female autonomy or authority in the political, intellectual, religious,
    or economic spheres, Female Power and Religious Change in the Medieval Near
    East is concerned with the capacity of women to affect religious communal
    affiliations thanks to their kinship ties.

    This book examines the religious lives of young adults growing up in
    inter-religious
     families in India. It explores complex questions of identity, social background, and
     religion in twenty-first-century India. The volume studies the religious commitments
     of young adults, analyses the identity formation process for a critical age group,
     and discusses the interpersonal dynamics within inter-religious families. Drawing
     on real life stories of mixed heritage - Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Christian, Jain, Buddhist,
     and Parsi - this volume will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of psychology,
     education, sociology and social anthropology, religious studies, politics, and other
     interdisciplinary studies

  abstract: >-
    Originally published in 1990, this book focuses on the challenge to Jewish
    identity posed by the conflicting forces of enlightenment, emancipation,
    modern political antisemitism, and secular ideologies like Zionism,
    nationalism, and socialism. At the heart of his discussion stands the
    intense, tortured, and ultimately tragic encounter of Jews with Germans and
    Austrians. He also deals at length with the new problems of Jewish cultural
    and political identity posed by the existence of the state of Israel and its
    embattled position among the nations. In the course of the analysis the book
    looks at the tragedy of assimilation in central Europe, with the optimistic
    dream of Enlightenment and Bildung coming to a climax in the nightmare of
    racial antisemitism and the Holocaust. He explores the ambivalent
    relationship of the Jews with the European Left, showing how many Jewish
    intellectuals found a new political home in radical and socialist movements,
    though these movements often retained negative stereotypes of Jews and
    Judaism and exhibited a fierce opposition to the maintenance of any separate
    Jewish identity. The role of Zionism is discussed and the more recent
    challenges to its legitimacy examined.
